# Changelog

## 0.4.0

  - Added a public `TailwindCombine.merge/1` API using the default config.

  - Added support for prefixed configs via `TailwindCombine.Config.new(prefix: ...)`.
  - Improved merge input handling for nested lists with `nil` and `false` values.
  - Greatly expanded parity coverage against the upstream JS test suite.
